# Contributing

Thanks for helping! Describble grows through small, focused contributions: a missing word, a new language, a new hat.

## Setup

You only need Node.js 20 or newer. There are no dependencies to install.

```bash
cd app
node build.mjs        # builds dist/index.html and dist/chat.html
node --test test/     # runs the test suite
```

Open `dist/index.html` in a browser for the live page. `dist/chat.html?mode=catalog` shows every piece, and `&only=hat` filters by slot.

## Adding a word

Most contributions are here. Open `app/src/lexicon.js`, find the trait and add the word to its list:

```js
'hat:beanie': ['berretto', 'beanie', 'knit hat', /* your word */],
```

- Words can be in any language. Multi-word phrases win over single words.
- A word in several lists turns on several traits at once: that is how archetypes like `vampire` work.
- Add a case to `app/test/parser.test.js` if the word fixes a real sentence that used to fail.
- If the word is listed in `app/lexicon-backlog.json`, remove it there: a test checks that the backlog only holds words that are still unknown.

## The word backlog

`app/lexicon-backlog.json` keeps the words people wrote that Describble does not understand yet, so they are not lost between releases. Each one is `todo` (waiting for a synonym or a new piece) or `skip` (left out on purpose, with the reason). Picking a `todo` word is a good first contribution.

## Reporting words it does not understand

Every time you pause while typing, the words the parser does not know are saved in your browser (localStorage). Open `dist/chat.html?mode=misses` to see them, most frequent first, with the sentence you wrote. Builds that have a collector also send those single words anonymously, as described in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

To suggest a word, open a **Word not understood** issue. If a word was understood but drawn wrong, open a **Drawn wrong** issue with what you wrote and a screenshot.

Maintainers turn the collector counts into a to-do list with:

```bash
cd app && EXPORT_TOKEN=… node scripts/triage.mjs https://<your-worker>/export --min=3
```

It lists the words still not understood, most frequent first, and sets apart the ones the current lexicon already handles. Each word ends as a synonym, a new piece, an entry in `ignored` (neutral words like "person"), or a deliberate gap (real brands, offensive words), always with a test.

## Adding a piece

1. Draw it in `app/src/pieces.js` on the 512×512 grid, using only absolute `M`, `C`, `L`, `Z` path commands. Keep the shared anchors: eyes at y≈266, mouth at y≈352, chin at y≈430.
2. Give every part a `layer` from `LAYERS` and use colour keys (`hair`, `hat`, `clothes`…) instead of fixed colours when the user should be able to recolour it.
3. Add the words for it in `lexicon.js` and, if it is a new kind of trait, a branch in `applyTrait` in `dialogue.js`.
4. Run the tests: one of them fails if a word points to a piece that does not exist.
5. Check it in the catalog page and attach a screenshot to your pull request.

## Code style

- Plain modern JavaScript, no runtime dependencies.
- The files in `app/src/` are concatenated into one script at build time, so top-level names must be unique across files.
- Keep `parser.js` and `dialogue.js` free of DOM code so they stay testable in Node.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request.
- Make sure `node --test test/` passes.
- Describe what you changed and, for visual changes, include a before/after screenshot.
