# Contributing

Thanks for helping! Describble grows through small, focused contributions: a missing word, a new language, a new hat.

## Setup

You only need Node.js 20 or newer. There are no dependencies to install.

```bash
cd app
node build.mjs        # builds dist/index.html and dist/chat.html
node --test test/     # runs the test suite
```

Open `dist/index.html` in a browser for the live page. `dist/chat.html?mode=catalog` shows every piece, and `&only=hat` filters by slot.

## Adding a word

Most contributions are here, and they need no code. The words live in [`dictionary/`](dictionary/), one file per language. Open the file of your language, for example `dictionary/lang/en.json`, find the concept and add the word to its list:

```json
"hat:beanie": ["beanie", "knit hat", "wool hat", "your word"],
```

- Words are lowercase. Multi-word phrases are fine and win over single words.
- A word listed under several concepts turns all of them on: that is how archetypes like `vampire` work.
- The concepts themselves (what can be drawn) are listed in `dictionary/concepts.json`; each one is backed by a piece in `app/src/pieces.js`.
- Run `node scripts/dictionary.mjs check` from `app/`: it tells you if something is off. Then `node --test test/`.
- Add a case to `app/test/parser.test.js` if the word fixes a real sentence that used to fail.
- If the word is listed in `app/lexicon-backlog.json`, remove it there: a test checks that the backlog only holds words that are still unknown.

## Adding a language

1. Copy `dictionary/lang/en.json` to `dictionary/lang/<code>.json` (two letters, e.g. `es.json`), set `language` and `name`, and replace the English words with yours. You don't need every concept at once. `dictionary/lang/pt.json` is a good example of a recent language.
2. Import the file in `app/src/lexicon.js` and add it to `dictionaryLanguages` there.
3. `node scripts/dictionary.mjs missing <code>` lists the concepts still without words, with the English ones as a hint.
4. Watch out for words that already mean something else in another language: every language shares one parser, which also forgives one-letter typos. Portuguese "bravo" (angry) would turn the Italian "bravo" (good) angry, so it was left out. Run the tests, and try a few sentences in the other languages too.
5. The website copy (`app/src/site.js`) and the replies (`app/src/dialogue.js`) can come later, in another pull request.

## The word backlog

`app/lexicon-backlog.json` keeps the words people wrote that Describble does not understand yet, so they are not lost between releases. Each one is `todo` (waiting for a synonym or a new piece) or `skip` (left out on purpose, with the reason). Picking a `todo` word is a good first contribution.

## Reporting words it does not understand

Every time you pause while typing, the words the parser does not know are saved in your browser (localStorage). Open `dist/chat.html?mode=misses` to see them, most frequent first, with the sentence you wrote. Builds that have a collector also send those single words anonymously, as described in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

To suggest a word, open a **Word not understood** issue. If a word was understood but drawn wrong, open a **Drawn wrong** issue with what you wrote and a screenshot.

Maintainers turn the collector counts into a to-do list with:

```bash
cd app && EXPORT_TOKEN=… node scripts/triage.mjs https://<your-worker>/export --min=3
```

It lists the words still not understood, most frequent first, and sets apart the ones the current lexicon already handles. Each word ends as a synonym, a new piece, an entry in `ignored` (neutral words like "person"), or a deliberate gap (real brands, offensive words), always with a test.

## Adding a piece

1. Draw it in `app/src/pieces.js` on the 512×512 grid, using only absolute `M`, `C`, `L`, `Z` path commands. Keep the shared anchors: eyes at y≈266, mouth at y≈352, chin at y≈430.
2. Give every part a `layer` from `LAYERS` and use colour keys (`hair`, `hat`, `clothes`…) instead of fixed colours when the user should be able to recolour it.
3. Add the words for it in `lexicon.js` and, if it is a new kind of trait, a branch in `applyTrait` in `dialogue.js`.
4. Run the tests: one of them fails if a word points to a piece that does not exist.
5. Check it in the catalog page and attach a screenshot to your pull request.

## Code style

- Plain modern JavaScript, no runtime dependencies.
- The files in `app/src/` are concatenated into one script at build time, so top-level names must be unique across files.
- Keep `parser.js` and `dialogue.js` free of DOM code so they stay testable in Node.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request.
- Make sure `node --test test/` passes.
- Describe what you changed and, for visual changes, include a before/after screenshot.
