# Word-report collector

A tiny Cloudflare Worker that counts the words Describble did not understand, so maintainers know which words to add to the lexicon. It is optional: without it, the app sends nothing.

## What it stores

Only `language, word → count`, for example `it:frullatore → 12`. No IP addresses, no sentences, no cookies, no identifiers. The app sends single lowercase words (capitalised words are skipped because they are usually names) and never sends anything when the browser signals Global Privacy Control or the user switches reports off.

## Deploy

Counts live in a D1 database (the free plan allows 100,000 writes a day; KV would allow only 1,000).

1. Create the database: `npx wrangler d1 create describble-words`.
2. Copy `wrangler.toml.example` to `wrangler.toml` (git-ignored) and paste the database id.
3. Create the table: `npx wrangler d1 execute describble-words --remote --file=schema.sql`.
4. Set the export secret: `npx wrangler secret put EXPORT_TOKEN --config wrangler.toml`.
5. Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.toml`. Always pass `--config` from this folder: the repository root has the website's own `wrangler.jsonc`.
6. Build the site with the collector address: `DESCRIBBLE_REPORT_ENDPOINT=https://words.describble.com/`. On Cloudflare Workers Builds this is a build variable. The site's Content Security Policy then allows that address and no other.

Only `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` may report words; requests from any other page get a 403.

## Read the counts

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPORT_TOKEN" https://words.describble.com/export
```

Or turn them straight into a to-do list, with the words the current lexicon already handles set apart:

```bash
cd app && EXPORT_TOKEN=… node scripts/triage.mjs https://words.describble.com/export --min=3
```

Add the frequent words to `app/src/lexicon.js`, with a regression test, and the next visitors will be understood.
